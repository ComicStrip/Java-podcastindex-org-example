Java example for https://podcastindex.org

this is original source code written by me (CSB)

how to use (on mac and PC and Linux)

1) download Android Studio or OpenJDK

2) download this repository either via "git clone" or via "Download ZIP" menu under "Code" button

3) replace "ABC" with proper values from https://api.podcastindex.org :
```
    String apiKey = "ABC";
    String apiSecret = "ABC";
```
4) compile (in case you use OpenJDK):
```
    javac PodcastingIndex.java
```
5) run:
```
    java PodcastingIndex
```

proof that it works on the example of virtual Linux running in iPad (but since Java is multi-platform, it will run also in Android and in all other platforms):
